What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It tells git that you want to use version control on the current directory. You still have to add the files you want to track to git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

It only includes files that you want to track in git. The repository is the set of files already tracked in git. This allows you to group only the files and changes you want into a logical unit prior to uploading them to git.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

You can selectively add only the files that affect the single change to the staging area even
if you have multiple changes made on your branch.
